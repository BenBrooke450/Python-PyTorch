# ðŸ”¹ What is Backpropagation?

* **Backpropagation** (short for *backward propagation of errors*) is the algorithm used to **train neural networks**.
* It computes how much each parameter (weight, bias) contributed to the error (loss) by applying the **chain rule of calculus**.
* This gives us the **gradients** (slopes of the loss function with respect to each parameter), which are then used by an optimizer (like SGD or Adam) to update the parameters.

# ðŸ”¹ Why We Need Backpropagation

* Neural networks can have **millions of parameters**.
* To train them, we must know:

  $$
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}, \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
  $$

  for every weight $w$ and bias $b$.
* Doing this manually would be impossible. Backprop automates it by systematically applying the **chain rule** backward through the network.

# ðŸ”¹ The Steps of Backpropagation

Letâ€™s say we have a simple 2-layer network:

$$
x \;\;\xrightarrow{W_1, b_1}\;\; h \;\;\xrightarrow{W_2, b_2}\;\; \hat{y}
$$

1. **Forward Pass**

   * Input $x$ goes through the network.
   * Each layer transforms it into hidden activations and outputs.
   * Compute prediction $\hat{y}$.
   * Compute loss $L(\hat{y}, y)$.

2. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**

   * Start with the gradient of the loss w\.r.t. the output:

     $$
     \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}}
     $$
   * Apply the chain rule backward through the layers:

     * Compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial b_2}$.
     * Propagate the error back into the hidden layer $h$.
     * Compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial b_1}$.

3. **Update Parameters**

   * Use gradients to nudge weights in the opposite direction of error.
   * Example with SGD:

     $$
     W = W - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
     $$

# ðŸ”¹ Intuition

* Forward pass: "What prediction do I make?"
* Loss: "How wrong was I?"
* Backward pass (backprop): "Whoâ€™s to blame, and by how much?"
* Optimizer: "Letâ€™s fix it step by step."

# ðŸ”¹ Backprop in PyTorch

PyTorch automates this process with **autograd**:

```python
# Forward pass
y_pred = model(x)
loss = criterion(y_pred, y)

# Backward pass (backpropagation)
loss.backward()   # computes dL/dÎ¸ for all Î¸

# Optimizer step
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

* Backpropagation = **the algorithm for the backward pass**.
* Itâ€™s just systematic application of the **chain rule**.
* It gives **gradients** for each parameter.
* Without backprop, training deep neural networks wouldnâ€™t be possible.

âš¡ In short: **Backpropagation is how a neural network learns which direction to adjust its weights in order to reduce the error.**
