In the context of tensors, especially when working with libraries like PyTorch, the term "dim" refers to the dimension of the tensor along which an operation is performed. Tensors can be thought of as multi-dimensional arrays, and the dimensions are often referred to as axes.

### Understanding Dimensions in Tensors

- **0-dimensional tensor:** A scalar, a single number.
- **1-dimensional tensor:** A vector, like a list of numbers.
- **2-dimensional tensor:** A matrix, with rows and columns.
- **n-dimensional tensor:** Higher-dimensional arrays, which can represent more complex data structures.

### `dim` Parameter

When you perform operations on tensors, such as `torch.argmin()`, you often specify a `dim` parameter to indicate along which dimension (or axis) the operation should be applied.

#### `dim=0`

- **Operation along `dim=0`:** This means the operation is applied along the first dimension (often thought of as "vertically" for a 2D tensor).
- **Example in a 2D tensor (matrix):** If you have a 2D tensor (matrix), applying an operation along `dim=0` means it is applied down each column. For example, finding the minimum value in each column of a matrix.

#### `dim=1`

- **Operation along `dim=1`:** This means the operation is applied along the second dimension (often thought of as "horizontally" for a 2D tensor).
- **Example in a 2D tensor (matrix):** If you have a 2D tensor, applying an operation along `dim=1` means it is applied across each row. For example, finding the minimum value in each row of a matrix.

# Example Tensor

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[3, 1, 4],
                  [2, 8, 5],
                  [7, 6, 9]])
print(x.shape)  # (3, 3)
```

# 1. `torch.argmin`

Finds the index of the **minimum value** along a given dimension.

```python
# dim=0 → operate down each column
print(torch.argmin(x, dim=0))  
# tensor([1, 0, 0]) → for each column, gives the row index of the min value

# dim=1 → operate across each row
print(torch.argmin(x, dim=1))  
# tensor([1, 0, 1]) → for each row, gives the column index of the min value

# no dim → flatten entire tensor
print(torch.argmin(x))  
# tensor(1) → index in flattened tensor (row 0, col 1 has min=1)
```

---

# 2. `torch.sum`

```python
# dim=0 → sum down columns
print(torch.sum(x, dim=0))  
# tensor([12, 15, 18])  (col sums)

# dim=1 → sum across rows
print(torch.sum(x, dim=1))  
# tensor([ 8, 15, 22])  (row sums)
```

---

# 3. `torch.mean`

```python
# dim=0 → mean per column
print(torch.mean(x.float(), dim=0))  
# tensor([4.0000, 5.0000, 6.0000])

# dim=1 → mean per row
print(torch.mean(x.float(), dim=1))  
# tensor([2.6667, 5.0000, 7.3333])
```

---

# 4. `torch.max` (returns both values and indices if `return_indices=True`)

```python
values, indices = torch.max(x, dim=0)
print(values)   # tensor([7, 8, 9])   → max of each column
print(indices)  # tensor([2, 1, 2])   → row index of max in each column
```

---

# 5. `torch.sort`

```python
sorted_vals, sorted_idx = torch.sort(x, dim=1)
print(sorted_vals)
# tensor([[1, 3, 4],
#         [2, 5, 8],
#         [6, 7, 9]])  → row-wise sort
```

---

 **Rule of thumb**:

* `dim=0` → go **down the rows**, apply function across rows (column-wise reduction).
* `dim=1` → go **across the columns**, apply function across columns (row-wise reduction).
* Higher dims (`dim=2`, `dim=3`, etc.) apply to deeper tensors (3D+, like images or sequences).

### Explanation

- **`dim=0`:** For each column in the tensor, `torch.argmin()` finds the index of the minimum value. In this example, it compares the elements in each column and returns the row index of the minimum value.

- **`dim=1`:** For each row in the tensor, `torch.argmin()` finds the index of the minimum value. In this example, it compares the elements in each row and returns the column index of the minimum value.

Understanding how dimensions work is crucial for manipulating tensors effectively, especially in machine learning and data processing tasks.
