## 1️⃣ Adding More Layers (Depth)

### What it means:

* Each layer in a neural network can be seen as a transformation of the input.
* Adding layers increases the **depth** of the network.
* Each additional layer allows the network to learn **more complex and abstract features**.

### Effects:

| Aspect               | Effect of More Layers                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Representation power | Higher – can approximate more complex functions (universal approximation theorem).                                               |
| Feature abstraction  | Deeper layers learn higher-level features. For example, in images: edges → textures → object parts → full objects.               |
| Gradient issues      | Can cause **vanishing or exploding gradients**, especially in very deep networks without proper initialization or normalization. |
| Training time        | More layers → more parameters → slower training.                                                                                 |
| Risk of overfitting  | More parameters can overfit small datasets unless regularization (dropout, weight decay) is applied.                             |

**Takeaway:** More layers are powerful for complex tasks but need careful tuning. Depth without enough data or regularization can hurt performance.

## 2️⃣ Increasing or Decreasing Batch Size

### What it means:

* Batch size = number of samples used in one forward/backward pass.
* Small batch: 16, 32, 64
* Large batch: 128, 256, 1024+

### Effects:

| Aspect            | Small Batch                                                                     | Large Batch                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gradient estimate | Noisy (stochastic) → introduces randomness → can escape local minima.           | More accurate gradient → smoother convergence but may get stuck in sharp minima.  |
| Training speed    | Slower per epoch (less parallelization), but potentially faster generalization. | Faster per epoch (better GPU utilization), but may generalize worse if too large. |
| Memory usage      | Low – can fit on smaller GPUs.                                                  | High – may exceed GPU memory.                                                     |
| Generalization    | Often better with smaller batch sizes.                                          | May require learning rate tuning; often worse generalization.                     |

**Rule of thumb:** Use the largest batch that fits in memory without hurting generalization. Small batches help regularize naturally.

## 3️⃣ Increasing Number of Epochs

### What it means:

* Epoch = one full pass through the entire training dataset.
* More epochs = the network sees the data more times.

### Effects:

| Aspect              | Fewer Epochs                                                                                           | More Epochs                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Training loss       | Might be high (underfitting).                                                                          | Decreases over time; may plateau. |
| Validation loss     | Can decrease initially, then increase if overfitting occurs.                                           |                                   |
| Risk of overfitting | Low with few epochs, high with too many epochs.                                                        |                                   |
| Convergence         | Sometimes, a network needs many epochs to converge if the learning rate is low or the task is complex. |                                   |

**Takeaway:** Early stopping is commonly used to prevent overfitting while still training enough epochs to converge.

## 4️⃣ Adding More Activation Layers

### What it means:

* Activation functions introduce **non-linearity**.
* A network without activations is just a linear model, no matter how many layers it has.

### Effects:

| Aspect         | More Activation Layers                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expressiveness | More non-linear transformations → can model more complex functions.                                  |
| Gradient flow  | Certain activations (ReLU) help gradient flow; others (sigmoid, tanh) can cause vanishing gradients. |
| Saturation     | Too many activations like sigmoid/tanh can saturate → slow learning.                                 |
| Choice matters | ReLU, Leaky ReLU, GELU, Swish often perform better in deep networks.                                 |

**Tip:** Every hidden layer should usually have an activation. Output activation depends on the task (softmax for classification, none for regression, etc.).

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Layers            | More abstraction, risk of overfitting, vanishing gradients | Less capacity, underfitting risk       | Use normalization/dropout for deep networks |
| Batch size        | Faster GPU usage, smoother gradients                       | Noisy gradients, better generalization | Trade-off between speed and generalization  |
| Epochs            | Better convergence, risk of overfitting                    | Underfitting                           | Use early stopping                          |
| Activation layers | More non-linearity → can model complex functions           | Fewer → model becomes linear           | Choose activations carefully                |

### ⚡ Key Insights

1. **Depth ≈ feature abstraction** – not always better; need data + regularization.
2. **Batch size** balances computational efficiency and generalization.
3. **Epochs** balance underfitting vs. overfitting.
4. **Activation layers** make the network non-linear; choice of activation affects gradient flow.
