## üî∏ What it does

* Loads an object that was saved with `torch.save()`.
* Reconstructs the original object in memory (tensor, model weights, checkpoint, etc.).
* Uses Python‚Äôs **`pickle`** module under the hood.

---

## üî∏ Syntax

```python
torch.load(f, map_location=None)
```

* `f` ‚Üí File name (e.g., `"model.pth"`) or file-like object.
* `map_location` ‚Üí Device mapping (useful when loading on CPU/GPU).

---

## üî∏ Common Use Cases

### 1. Load a Tensor

```python
x_loaded = torch.load("tensor.pth")
print(x_loaded)
```

---

### 2. Load Model Parameters (Best Practice ‚úÖ)

```python
model = MyModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
model.eval()   # set to evaluation mode
```

* Here `torch.load("model.pth")` gives back the `state_dict` (a dictionary of tensors).
* `load_state_dict()` applies it to the model.

---

### 3. Load Entire Model (Not Recommended ‚ùå)

```python
model = torch.load("entire_model.pth")
```

* Works but less portable, since it requires the exact same class definition.

---

### 4. Load Training Checkpoint

```python
checkpoint = torch.load("checkpoint.pth")
epoch = checkpoint["epoch"]
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint["model_state"])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint["optimizer_state"])
loss = checkpoint["loss"]
```

---

## üî∏ `map_location` (Important for Devices)

* Sometimes you save a model on **GPU**, but load it on **CPU** (or vice versa).
* Use `map_location` to handle this:

```python
# Load GPU-trained model on CPU
state_dict = torch.load("model.pth", map_location=torch.device("cpu"))
model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```

```python
# Force load on GPU
state_dict = torch.load("model.pth", map_location=torch.device("cuda"))
```

---

## üî∏ Key Notes

* `torch.load()` must match the saving method:

  * If you saved `state_dict`, load with `load_state_dict()`.
  * If you saved a full model, load directly (but not best practice).
* Always follow with `model.eval()` when using the model for inference.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
`torch.load()` is used to **deserialize and load objects (tensors, model weights, checkpoints) saved with `torch.save()`**. It restores the saved object into memory, often followed by applying it to a model via `.load_state_dict()`. Use `map_location` to control device placement when moving between CPU and GPU.
