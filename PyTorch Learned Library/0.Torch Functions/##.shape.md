### Explanation of `.shape`

- **Purpose:** Returns a tuple representing the size of the tensor in each dimension.

- **Usage:** You can access the `.shape` attribute directly from a tensor object.

- **Returns:** A tuple where each element represents the size of the corresponding dimension.

### Examples of `.shape`

Here are several examples demonstrating how to use the `.shape` attribute in PyTorch:

```python

import torch

# Example 1: Shape of a 0D tensor (scalar)
scalar_tensor = torch.tensor(5)
print("Shape of scalar tensor:", scalar_tensor.shape)
#Shape of scalar tensor: torch.Size([])

# Example 2: Shape of a 1D tensor (vector)
vector_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Shape of 1D tensor:", vector_tensor.shape)
#Shape of 1D tensor: torch.Size([4])

# Example 3: Shape of a 2D tensor (matrix)
matrix_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Shape of 2D tensor:", matrix_tensor.shape)
#Shape of 2D tensor: torch.Size([2, 3])

# Example 4: Shape of a 3D tensor
tensor_3d = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print("Shape of 3D tensor:", tensor_3d.shape)
#Shape of 3D tensor: torch.Size([2, 2, 2])

# Example 5: Shape of a higher-dimensional tensor
tensor_4d = torch.zeros(2, 3, 4, 5)
print("Shape of 4D tensor:", tensor_4d.shape)
#Shape of 4D tensor: torch.Size([2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### Explanation of the Examples

- **Example 1:** A scalar tensor has no dimensions, so the `.shape` attribute returns an empty tuple `()`.

- **Example 2:** A 1-dimensional tensor (vector) has one dimension with a size of 4, so the `.shape` attribute returns `(4,)`.

- **Example 3:** A 2-dimensional tensor (matrix) has two dimensions. The first dimension has a size of 2 (rows), and the second dimension has a size of 3 (columns), so the `.shape` attribute returns `(2, 3)`.

- **Example 4:** A 3-dimensional tensor has three dimensions. The sizes of the dimensions are 2, 2, and 2, respectively, so the `.shape` attribute returns `(2, 2, 2)`.

- **Example 5:** A 4-dimensional tensor has four dimensions with sizes 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, so the `.shape` attribute returns `(2, 3, 4, 5)`.

The `.shape` attribute is essential for understanding the structure of tensors and ensuring that operations are applied correctly based on the tensor's dimensions.
