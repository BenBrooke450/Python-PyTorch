### Explanation of `.ndim`

- **Purpose:** Returns the number of dimensions of a tensor.

- **Usage:** You can access the `.ndim` attribute directly from a tensor object.

- **Returns:** An integer representing the number of dimensions of the tensor.

### Examples of `.ndim`

Here are several examples demonstrating how to use the `.ndim` attribute in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Number of dimensions in a 0D tensor (scalar)
scalar_tensor = torch.tensor(5)
print("Number of dimensions in scalar tensor:", scalar_tensor.ndim)
#Number of dimensions in scalar tensor: 0


# Example 2: Number of dimensions in a 1D tensor (vector)
vector_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Number of dimensions in 1D tensor:", vector_tensor.ndim)
#Number of dimensions in 1D tensor: 1


# Example 3: Number of dimensions in a 2D tensor (matrix)
matrix_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Number of dimensions in 2D tensor:", matrix_tensor.ndim)
#Number of dimensions in 1D tensor: 2


# Example 4: Number of dimensions in a 3D tensor
tensor_3d = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print("Number of dimensions in 3D tensor:", tensor_3d.ndim)
#Number of dimensions in 1D tensor: 3


# Example 5: Number of dimensions in a higher-dimensional tensor
tensor_4d = torch.zeros(2, 3, 4, 5)
print("Number of dimensions in 4D tensor:", tensor_4d.ndim)
#Number of dimensions in 1D tensor: 4
```

### Explanation of the Examples

- **Example 1:** A scalar tensor has 0 dimensions. The `.ndim` attribute returns `0`.

- **Example 2:** A 1-dimensional tensor (vector) has 1 dimension. The `.ndim` attribute returns `1`.

- **Example 3:** A 2-dimensional tensor (matrix) has 2 dimensions. The `.ndim` attribute returns `2`.

- **Example 4:** A 3-dimensional tensor has 3 dimensions. The `.ndim` attribute returns `3`.

- **Example 5:** A 4-dimensional tensor has 4 dimensions. The `.ndim` attribute returns `4`.

The `.ndim` attribute is useful for understanding the structure of tensors and ensuring that operations are applied correctly based on the tensor's dimensionality.
