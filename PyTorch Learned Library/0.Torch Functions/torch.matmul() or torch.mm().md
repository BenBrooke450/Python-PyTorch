### Summary of `torch.matmul()`

- **Purpose:** Performs matrix multiplication on two tensors.

- **Syntax:**
  ```python
  torch.matmul(input, other, out=None)
  ```

- **Parameters:**
  - `input`: The first tensor to be multiplied.
  - `other`: The second tensor to be multiplied.
  - `out` (optional): An output tensor to store the result.

- **Returns:** A tensor containing the result of the matrix multiplication.

- **Behavior:**
  - If both tensors are 1-dimensional, it computes the dot product (scalar).
  - If both tensors are 2-dimensional, it performs traditional matrix multiplication.
  - For tensors with more than 2 dimensions, it performs a batch matrix multiply, treating the leading dimensions as batch dimensions.

### Example of `torch.matmul()`

Here's a code example demonstrating how to use `torch.matmul()`:

```python
import torch

tensor_A = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])

tensor_B = torch.tensor([[3,2,1],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]])

print(tensor_A.shape, tensor_B.shape)
#torch.Size([3, 3]) torch.Size([3, 3]), The inner 3]) * ([3 mst be the same])




tensor_A = torch.tensor([[1,2],[4,5],[7,8]])

tensor_B = torch.tensor([[3,2],[6,5],[7,8]])

print(tensor_A.shape, tensor_B.shape)
#torch.Size([3, 2]) torch.Size([3, 2])  THIS WOULD FAIL






# Example 1: Dot product of two 1D tensors
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])
result1 = torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2)
print("Dot product:", result1)
#Dot product: tensor(32)

# Example 2: Matrix multiplication of two 2D tensors
tensor3 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor4 = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result2 = torch.matmul(tensor3, tensor4)
print("Matrix multiplication:\n", result2)
"""
Matrix multiplication:
 tensor([[19, 22],
        [43, 50]])
"""

# Example 3: Batch matrix multiplication
tensor5 = torch.randn(3, 4, 5)  # Random tensor of shape (3, 4, 5)
tensor6 = torch.randn(3, 5, 2)  # Random tensor of shape (3, 5, 2)
result3 = torch.matmul(tensor5, tensor6)
print("Batch matrix multiplication shape:", result3.shape)
#Batch matrix multiplication shape: torch.Size([3, 4, 2])
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Example 1:** Computes the dot product of two 1-dimensional tensors, resulting in a single scalar value.

- **Example 2:** Performs traditional matrix multiplication on two 2-dimensional tensors, resulting in another 2-dimensional tensor.

- **Example 3:** Demonstrates batch matrix multiplication. The tensors have shapes `(3, 4, 5)` and `(3, 5, 2)`, and the result is a tensor of shape `(3, 4, 2)`. This example shows how `torch.matmul()` can handle higher-dimensional tensors by treating the leading dimensions as batch dimensions.

`torch.matmul()` is a powerful function for performing matrix multiplications in PyTorch, and it is widely used in various machine learning and deep learning applications.
