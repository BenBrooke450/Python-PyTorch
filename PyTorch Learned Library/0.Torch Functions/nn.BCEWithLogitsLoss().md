# `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`

### What it is

* A **binary classification loss function** that combines:

  1. **Sigmoid activation** (on model outputs / logits), and
  2. **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss**.

* Instead of manually applying a `Sigmoid` then passing to `BCELoss`, you use `BCEWithLogitsLoss` for **numerical stability and efficiency**.

---

### Formula

Given predictions (logits) **z = f(x)** and binary labels **y ∈ {0,1}**:

1. First, apply sigmoid internally:
   ŷ = σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(−z))

2. Compute the binary cross-entropy:

   L(y, z) = − \[ y · log(σ(z)) + (1 − y) · log(1 − σ(z)) ]

PyTorch implements this in a **numerically stable form** (avoiding overflow/underflow in `exp`).

### ⚙Arguments

```python
torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(weight=None, size_average=None, 
                           reduce=None, reduction='mean', 
                           pos_weight=None)
```

* **`reduction`** (`'mean'`, `'sum'`, `'none'`): how to aggregate losses.
* **`weight`** (Tensor, optional): rescaling weight for each sample.
* **`pos_weight`** (Tensor, optional): rescale positive examples (helpful for imbalanced datasets).

---

### When to use it

* **Binary classification** (two classes: 0 or 1).
* **Multi-label classification** (each sample can belong to multiple classes independently).
* Especially useful when:

  * The dataset is **imbalanced** (use `pos_weight`).
  * You want **numerical stability** (better than `Sigmoid` + `BCELoss` separately).

---

### Example Usage

#### Binary classification

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

loss_fn = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# logits (before sigmoid)
y_pred = torch.tensor([[0.8], [-1.2], [2.4]])  
# targets (ground truth labels)
y_true = torch.tensor([[1.], [0.], [1.]])

loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_true)
print(loss.item())
```

#### With class imbalance (`pos_weight`)

```python
# Suppose positives are rare → give them more weight
pos_weight = torch.tensor([3.0])
loss_fn = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
```

---

### Why it’s better than `BCELoss(Sigmoid(x))`

* **`BCELoss` with sigmoid:** prone to numerical instability if logits are very large (overflow in `exp`).
* **`BCEWithLogitsLoss`:** implements a **stable formulation** by combining sigmoid and log terms directly.

For example, it avoids computing `log(1 − sigmoid(z))`, which can underflow when z is very negative.

---

### Typical Systems

* Logistic regression (binary).
* Neural networks for binary outputs.
* Multi-label classification (e.g. predicting multiple tags per image).
* Imbalanced datasets (medical diagnosis, fraud detection).

---

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting logits vs probabilities**

   * Pass **raw logits** from the model, **not sigmoid outputs**.
   * If you apply `sigmoid` yourself, you’ll squash values twice and training won’t work.

2. **Wrong target shape**

   * Targets must be float tensors (`0.` or `1.`), not integer class labels.
   * Shape of `y_true` must match `y_pred`.

3. **Imbalanced data not handled**

   * If positives are rare, use `pos_weight` to prevent the model from predicting only negatives.

---

### **In summary:**
`torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` = `Sigmoid` + `BCELoss` in one, done in a numerically stable way.
It’s the go-to choice for **binary and multi-label classification problems** in PyTorch.
